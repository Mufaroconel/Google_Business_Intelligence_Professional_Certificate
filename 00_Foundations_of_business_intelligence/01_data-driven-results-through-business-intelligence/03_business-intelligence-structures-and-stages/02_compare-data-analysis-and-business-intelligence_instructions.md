While both DA and BI involve using data to create insights, they differ in focus and approach. DA is more focused on analyzing data to answer specific questions, while BI involves creating processes and tools for continuous data gathering and providing actionable insights to decision-makers. DA often deals with individual analyses, while BI focuses on establishing systematic processes for ongoing data utilization and optimization.
