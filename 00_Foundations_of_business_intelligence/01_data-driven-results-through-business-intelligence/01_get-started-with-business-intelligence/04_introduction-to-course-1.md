There are an endless
number of reasons to pursue a career in
business intelligence. Enjoying analytical thinking
or having an interest in numbers are wonderful
motivations for becoming a BI professional. But there's so much more
to the world of BI. Maybe you're passionate
about solving problems, simplifying processes, or removing
pain points for others. Perhaps you have great
communication skills, and you'd like to use them to share insights and help your team make
effective decisions. Lots of people in BI enjoy
creating tools that streamline tasks and enable
their colleagues to devote more time
to other projects. BI professionals are
inspired in all kinds of ways. But when I talked to my
colleagues here at Google, the thing they love
most is simply using their talents to
make other people happy. There's a lot of satisfaction
in knowing that you've made someone's job easier or saved them a bunch of
time. And right now, you've made me happy
because you're here to explore the exciting and
rewarding career path, the BI. In this first course, you will begin learning
about the BI industry. If this is new
territory for you, you'll discover how to
identify the career path and employer type that best suits
your skills and interests. You'll also consider
the roles of BI analysts versus BI engineers. If you already have
some BI experience, we'll open new doors to more fascinating
career opportunities. You'll understand how to develop a BI project that
makes an impact. You'll be introduced to BI tools and techniques that
professionals use every day for making business decisions and
improving processes. The similarities and differences between BI and data
analytics will be clarified. And together we will
explore the importance of context when working
with data and learn how to overcome
some common limitations, such as human bias. Then throughout the program, you'll continue
gaining new skills. You will use data
modeling to design data storage systems
such as data warehouses, data marts, and data lakes. You apply data pipelines
and the ETL process. Designing and
interpreting dashboards will be an essential
part of your learning, as well as communicating with stakeholders about
your findings. Finally, you'll prepare for your job search by developing
a personal strategy, growing your
professional network, and preparing materials. Most of the content in
this program builds upon core data
analytics concepts. If you have some
experience in that area, or if you earned your Google
Data Analytics certificate, then you've definitely
come to the right place. If you're unsure about having the necessary prerequisites
for this program, there's an ungraded
assessment coming up soon to evaluate your readiness. In addition, we'll include
helpful resources from the Google Data Analytics certificate throughout
each course, which you can use to
