Connecting with your classmates is an essential part of any online course. Get to know each other using the discussion forums and prompts. Discussion prompts are course items that have associated threads in the discussion forums. When you answer a discussion prompt, your response goes to the associated forum, along with the responses of your peers.

Establishing personal interaction with other learners will make your online learning experience much more enjoyable and engaging. And given the probability that many workplaces will have virtual meetings and hybrid or remote work environments, it's also important to begin practicing building relationships and giving and receiving feedback online. We encourage you to use the forums to deepen your learning and peer relationships.
Share with other learners

Tell everyone a bit about yourself. Then, read some of your classmates' postings. Pick at least two postings that are interesting to you and add a friendly or encouraging response back.

To begin, go to the Sharing Questions and Concerns discussion prompt to introduce yourself. Then, go to the discussion forum , find introduction posts from other learners, and interact with them. Going forward, if you want to use the discussion forum for a question outside of the discussion prompts, click the Create post button to begin a new thread.
Update your profile

Additionally, consider updating your profile , which can be accessed by clicking the Profile link. When classmates find you in the discussion forums, they can click on your name to view your complete profile and get to know you more.
Upvote posts

When you enter the discussion forum for your course, you will find an Upvote button under each post. We encourage you to upvote posts that you find thoughtful, interesting, or helpful. This is the best way to ensure that other learners will read quality posts in the course. Upvoting also increases the likelihood that important questions get addressed and answered.

Improve your posts

Course discussion forums are your chance to interact with thousands of like-minded individuals around the world. In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more respectful and productive communication.

    Stay on topic in existing forums and threads. Off-topic posts make it difficult for other learners to find information they need.

    Post in the most appropriate forum for your topic, and don’t post the same thing in multiple forums.

    Use the filters at the top of the forum page (Latest, Top, and Unanswered) to find active, interesting content.

    Upvote posts that you find helpful and interesting.

    Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all personal attacks. You will be communicating with learners from around the world, with different styles of engaging. Remember to be respectful when discussing concepts or asking for clarification.

    Make sure you are understood. To be helpful to learners using English as a second language, try to write full sentences, and avoid text-message abbreviations or slang. Be careful when you use humor and sarcasm, as these can be easy to misinterpret.

    If you are asking a question, provide as much information as possible before or after posing your question. For example, you might write what you’ve already considered, what you’ve already read, etc.

    Cite appropriate references when using someone else’s ideas, thoughts, or words.

    Don’t use a forum to promote your product, service, or business.

    Invite other learners to extend the discussion with an open-ended statement or question. For example, you might write something like, “I would love to understand what others think.”

    Don’t post personal information about other posters or yourself in the forum.

    Report spam and spammers.
