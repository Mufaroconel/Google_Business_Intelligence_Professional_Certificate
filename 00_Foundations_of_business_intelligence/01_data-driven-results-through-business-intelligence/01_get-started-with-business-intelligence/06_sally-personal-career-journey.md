Hi, I'm Sally. I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst
at Google. What that means is, I work with data to help improve
the hiring experience at Google. The way in which I entered data analytics
is via a business boot camp that I did years ago. I was thinking of
becoming biomedical researcher and this is something I just wanted
to use during extra time that I had. We learned about just data
analysis in general and I found that I had like a knack for it. Everything just made sense. It was very tangible. You can see the results pretty immediately
and you could search for things. I love puzzles, so
trying to find using different clues and trying to find what is the answer. And I really enjoyed it as well
as enjoyed working with teams, which is different from
when I was in the sciences. It was very much independent,
I was doing my own thing. But within the business boot camp,
I was working within a group of people and that was so social and so much fun. And we were supporting each other and
I love that, that team environment. Through the program is
how I got my first job. There was someone I met on the program
who graduated a year before me. And when it was time for me to apply for
jobs, he had an opening on his team and he reached out to me to
see if I wanted to apply. So that's actually how I
got into data analytics. I didn't study data analytics. I had to teach myself everything from,
I had to teach myself SQL. I didn't feel like I was
really contributing or that I had any security in this field. And so what I tried to do is I
try to teach myself python, go into machine learning, and what not. But ultimately, what I found is,
I don't need to do that. I just need to find a niche - what
I'm good at - and develop that and become an expert in that. So the advice that I would give for someone who's trying to enter the field
of business intelligence, is to consider the difference between
data analytics and business intelligence. I personally found that
I really like SQL. Love SQL on the technical
side of things. In addition to that, so I wanted to level
up and enter business intelligence. You can make your career within
the broader field of data analytics be whatever you want,
depending on what it is that you enjoy.
